	  Artificial Intelligence has come into a golden age with programs like OpenAI&#8242;s DALL&#8211;E 2, which can &#8220;create realistic images and art from a description in natural language&#8221; (OpenAI 2022). These new AI programs that keep producing more impressive results, many have begun to wonder how AI will affect the future. AI may become so powerful in the future that they could provide a utopia, or mankind&#8242;s downfall. There is reason to believe that AI will most likely lead to the latter because of the goal&#8211;oriented nature of AI and the ignorance of human values.
	</p><p style="text-indent:50px">
	AI is obviously based on coding, which typically means that these coded programs are goal oriented. This means that AI will do things in order to accomplish a specified goal. AI will &#8220;choose the easiest and simple methods to achieve their goals&#8221; (Kaonga 2019). This is what humans do as well, using problem&#8211;solving skills to complete a task in the easiest way possible. This makes sense if taken at a glance, but the problem arises when you look at it more closely. Professor Stuart Russell explains that &#8220;In order to stop robots potentially destroying the human race,... scientists could change the way AI is engineered so it doesn&#8242;t focus on a goal&#8211;orientated mindset&#8221; (Kaonga 2019).
	</p><p style="text-indent:50px">
	This is because of the lack of interest in human values. These robots&#8242; only reason to exist is to finish the job, so that could mean taking desperate measures to do so. A good example of this was created by Paul Christiano, who made an example of a Nike robot whose goal was to maximize profits, so in order to do so, it would find killing Reebok customers to be a very effective solution (Matthews 2019). This seems a bit extreme, almost comical, but it illustrates how robots don&#8242;t have morals for what is right and wrong, so if not given specific instructions, could lead to the end of the world.
