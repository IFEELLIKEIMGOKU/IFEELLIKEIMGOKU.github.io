	Hello, I am Devon Leerssen. I was born and raised in Texas, never moved. I am a student at Allen High School who plans to pursue a degree and eventually a career in Computer Science. Currently a junior at Allen High School in Computer Science II, I have have learned the coding languages of HTML5 and Swift from this class, although I plan to learn more throughout this year's class. With a year of Computer Science and a lifetime of computer experience at my disposal, I hope to impress with my coding abilities. I grew up loving computers and playing video games, whether its always trying to be the best in the video games I play or browsing the internet for information to absorb. Because of this, I would love to base my career around computers.  Specifically, I hope to pursue a career in either software development or game development, as I enjoy coding and I know a lot about game design and game mechanics.

	  My Digital Portfolio allows me to display my skills in coding and provide information to future recruiters about myself. It could be used for college admissions or potential business oppurtunities. Colleges can see into what I'm capable of coding and my essay writing skills. Businesses can use my projects as a basis of how they can use me in their aspirations. No matter what specific career in Computer Science I decide to pursue, I can use my digital portfolio to help me attain my goals.
