	</p>
	<p>
	  My ISP, or Independent Study Project, was a project done in my Computer Science class where we were required to make a video game coded in swift on the IGIS engine. I chose to make a game in which you are a square that can jump over spikes and obstales. However, instead of the square moving across the screen, the level scrolls and you jump over obstacles as they come to you.

	      Motivation
	</b></p>
	<p>
	  My main motivation for this project was the impending deadline for when it was due.
	</p>

	      Conclusions
	</b></p>
	<p>
	  What went expected is that the project ended up taking a long time. We finished just barely before it was due. This is because me and my group members were not very efficient in coding. What did not go expected is how hard it is to make a group proect with others. At first we tried to do this project without communication besides in class, and that was a horrible mistake.

	    Code Segment 1
	</b></p>
	<p>
	  This code segment displays how the infinite background scrolling was done. Basically, 2 images are put side by side and scroll to the edge of the screen. Once the first image's top left corner passes the edge of the screen, the two images are teleported back. This gives the illusion of infinite scrolling.

	    Code Segment 2
	</b></p>
	<p>
	  This code segment displays a function that when given an x and y value, it draws a spike in that location. This is done by using the x and y values given to draw a path to create a spike.
