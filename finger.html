	  What does the S stand for in HTTPS? It stands for secure, and websites use fingerprints to stay secure. However, this system is not perfect, and there are flaws with fingerprints. This essay will discuss what fingerprints are, how they work, and some problems with fingerprints.
	</p><p style="text-indent:50px">
	The two primary purposes of fingerprints are to &#8220know that we are really connected to our bank, our records database, or any other public or private website&#8221 and &#8220network traffic monitoring&#8221 (Gibson 2020). What are fingerprints? Explained in simple terms, fingerprints are a website&#8242s unique hash. It&#8242s a string of hexadecimal numbers that is different for every website. If even one bit is changed in the website&#8242s file, then the fingerprint will change by 50% on average (Gibson 2020). Each hash can be approved by a CA, or Certificate Authority, who is a person or company that specializes in &#8220issuing digital certificates that can verify identities&#8221 (Keyfactor, 2022). Basically, these certificates state that the website is safe and trustable. So if someone were to copy google&#8242s website exactly, but under a different domain, then they would not have a certificate, therefore users can know not to use that website.
	</p><p style="text-indent:50px">
	The problem is that there is a flaw with these certificates. HTTPS Proxy can be installed on computers to intercept web traffic without the user knowing, called an SSL interception, and it is impossible to prevent. These programs make users believe they are directly connected to the website, however they are actually connected to a web server through the proxy. They do this by adding &#8220one additional &#8242trusted&#8242 Certificate Authority to each computer&#8221 (Gibson 2020). This creates a MITM, man in the middle, attack, where the proxy &#8220positions [itself] in a conversation between a user and an application&#8221, allowing the proxy to see all the information sent from the website and the user (Imperva 2021).
	</p><p style="text-indent:50px">
	Although this cannot be prevented, it can be detected. Remember that each website has a unique hash. The proxy must &#8220provide a fraudulent spoofed certificate containing a public key,&#8221 and that public key, or hash, will not match the site&#8242s public key. If they do not match, then users will know that they&#8242re information is not safe (Gibson 2020). However, false positives can happen, where you believe users believe that they are being intercepted because the keys don&#8242t match, but that&#8242s just because companies can &#8220deploy many different security certificates across their many globally distributed servers and web sites&#8221 (Gibson 2020). False negatives can happen when an anti-malware product uses SSL interception on purpose to prevent malware, however &#8220since you are always being intercepted, you can never verify whether it&#8242s only once&#8221 (Gibson 2020).
	</p><p style="text-indent:50px">
	Is SSL proxy necessary? Yes, in very specific circumstances. Students should not be doing shady things on a school computer. Any other time, never. No company or government organization should have the power to see every website you access and every password and account you enter in on a websites. The privacy breach is way too obtrusive and violates our rights.
